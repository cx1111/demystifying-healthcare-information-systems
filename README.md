## Workshop Abstract

Big data, precision medicine, cloud computing, API, data lakeâ€¦ What does all this mean, and what do we actually need for our overarching goal of extracting insights from healthcare data? This workshop explains the fundamental computing concepts behind medical (and non-medical) information systems, including client-server interactions, relational databases, APIs, and web services. These concepts will then be pieced together to describe how most medical applications are built and utilized.

The building process of the MIMIC database from its various sources will be explained to demonstrate how disparate data sources can be combined and utilized. Emphasis will be put on understanding concepts,and clarifying unnecessary technical jargon. As concepts are explained, attendees will demonstrate their understanding by turning raw demo data into an analyzable healthcare database, running some basic analyses, and building a web service to make the database accessible.


## Content Organization

- The Jupyter notebooks in the base directory contain the code for the demostrations and exercises.
- The `data` directory contains the data to be used in the processing and analysis exercises.
- The `smarthealth` directory contains a demo intelligent health web app.
